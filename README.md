# Shopping Cart

This shopping cart app is a replica of the [Eminem merch store](https://shop.eminem.com/collections/kamikaze). I created this app following [TheOdinProject](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/node-path-javascript-shopping-cart) JavaScript curriculum. This project was created to solidfy knowledge with React, and to learn how to use BrowserRouter, Routes, Links, and incorporate the TDD process with React testing.

## Languages/Tools Used

HTML/CSS/JavaScript

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) and utilizes the 'react-router-dom' library.
